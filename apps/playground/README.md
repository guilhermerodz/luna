### Roadmap

#### Dashboard-like software

The priority audience is developers who are building dashboard-like software. The goal is to make it easy to apply visual effects to their software.

- Border:
  - [x] Tracing Border
  - [ ] Top Light (inspired by Resend)
- Background:
  - [ ] Frosted Glass (might be unnecessary because backdrop-blur css is easy to use)

  - [ ] Badge Reflection
- Texture:
  - ?
- Animation:
  - ?
- Shadow:
  - ?
- Content:
  - [ ] Blur+fade placeholder (name TBD) (inspired by Luxe)

### FAQ

**Isn't this the same as Aceternity UI?**

No. Aceternity's approach is more imperative. It provide examples on how to build the VFX from scratch or which libraries to use.
It might take several minutes or an hour for a developer to understand what's happening under the hood, even with a code example.
Luna's goal is to provide you production-ready VFX, which can be added as a layer to your design system in less than a minute.

**How to use with my existing Design System?**

You might already be using a UI library or design system. Everyone does.
Luna's CLI act like shadcn-ui does. It will copy-paste VFX components into your project. You can then simply import them inside of your primitives, such as `components/Button,Input,Card`, etc.

**Are the components fully customizable?**

Yes. I've setup CSS variables on top of each CSS file so you can easily change the colors, durations, or tokens in general. You can also change all of the HTML & CSS structure.
